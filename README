#Introduction
This is a simulation of a database for a streaming application. This project also implements some of
the application actions that influence the database that is simulated. The actions of the users that
involve the database are:

 * commands -> mark as favorite, view, rate, etc;
 * queries -> search by filters;
 * recommendations -> ask the application for a recommendation

#Entry-point
The main class for the database is main/Database.java, but it does not contain an actual entry-point
to a program. The class main/Main.java implements an entrypoint for testing the functionality of the
simulation.

#Run
The program reads input from a JSON and writes the output into another. The entry-point implemented
for testing will require a certain input from the user - the name of the input file which will be
looked up in the test_db/test_files directory.
